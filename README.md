# MongoCluster

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/mongo_cluster`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

          journal:
            path: !FindInMap [storage, journal, path]
            device: !FindInMap [storage, journal, device]
          log:
            path: !FindInMap [storage, log, path]
            device: !FindInMap [storage, log, device]
        security:

        replication:
          name: !Ref ReplicaSetName
          port: !Ref Port
          size: !Ref Size

Create storage mounts for log, journal, data and efs based on Configuration Metadata.
Decrypt KeyFile resource with KMS to `/mongo_auth/mongodb.key`.
Define Mongo Configuration to `/etc/mongod.conf` based on Configuration Metadata.
Set the Mongo Service to boot at startup.

    $ /usr/local/bin/install_mongo
    
**Install Monitor:**

Metadata on PrimaryInstance:

      Configuration:
        monitor:
          api_key: !If [Monitor, !GetAtt EncryptedDataDogApiKey.CipherText, !Ref DataDogApiKey]
          
Define DataDog Configuration to `/etc/dd-agent/datadog.conf`.
Integrate Mongo statistics to DataDog via Configuration in `/etc/dd-agent/conf.d/mongo.yaml`

    $ /usr/local/bin/install_monitor


**Install Backup Scheduler:**

Metadata on PrimaryInstance:

      Configuration:
        backup:
          enabled: !Ref Backup
          snapshot_interval: !Ref SnapshotInterval
          retention_expiration:
            minutely: !Ref MinutelyExpriation
            hourly: !Ref HourlyExpiration

Create backup daemon to schedule snapshot, dump and clean up jobs.

        $ /usr/local/bin/install_backup_scheduler
        $ /usr/local/bin/backup_scheduler start|stop|status|restart
   
   
**Define ReplicaSet:**

Metadata on each ReplicaInstance:

      ReplicaMember:
        id: 1
        host: !Sub
          - ${Host}:${Port}
          - {Host: !GetAtt PrimaryNetworkInterface.PrimaryPrivateIpAddress, Port: !Ref Port}
        hidden: false
        priority: 10
        votes: 1
      
Should run only on the Primary instance.
Wait to all cloudformation instance to complete creation.
Initiate ReplicaSet based on all instances metadata
Create root and monitor users.

        $ /usr/local/bin/define_replica_set

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
